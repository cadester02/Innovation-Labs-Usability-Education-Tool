      <h1>Heuristic 4: Consistency and standards</h1>
      <p>
        The “consistency and standards” heuristic advocates for the system to follow established conventions throughout
        the interface. Creating conventions that adhere to user expectations can reduce confusion and cognitive load,
        create a sense of familiarity, and allow users to understand a new aspect of the system easier by drawing on
        their knowledge of previous interactions within the system.
