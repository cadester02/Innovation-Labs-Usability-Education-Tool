      <h1>Providing Information to the User</h1>
      <h3>Heuristic 4: Consistency and standards & Heuristic 10: Help and documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Both the “consistency and standards” and “help and documentation” heuristics promote usability by encouraging
        an environment that is both coherent and has support to assist users. When implemented, both heuristics help to
        increase system usability and user productivity.
        <br /><br />
        The “consistency and standards” heuristic advocates for the system to follow established conventions throughout
        the interface. Creating conventions that adhere to user expectations can reduce confusion and cognitive load,
        create a sense of familiarity, and allow users to understand a new aspect of the system easier by drawing on
        their knowledge of previous interactions within the system.
        <br /><br />
        “Help and documentation” refers to the importance of providing assistance to the user when they need it. This
        could include FAQs, tutorials, or more in-depth guides. If done correctly, “help and documentation” aids users
        in learning about the system as well as resolving any issues they might have.
