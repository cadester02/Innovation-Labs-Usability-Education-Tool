      <p>
        On the other hand, “flexibility and efficiency of use” encourages designing interfaces that cater to both new
        and expert users. Ways to increase a system’s “flexibility and efficiency of use” include the ability for users
        to create custom keyboard shortcuts, customizable settings, and functionalities that expedite more laborious
        tasks on the system. This allows both frequent users and newcomers to optimize their work environment in a way
        that best suits them.
