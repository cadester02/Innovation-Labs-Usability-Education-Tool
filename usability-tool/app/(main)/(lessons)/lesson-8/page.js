        Since these indicators will be visible at almost all times, it is important that they follow an aesthetic and
        minimalist design.  This means that the visual design of the UI is focused on the information most relevant to
        the user.  Unnecessary indicators will only serve to clutter the screen and draw attention away from what the
        user is looking for.
