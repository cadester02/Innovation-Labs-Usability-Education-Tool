      <h3>Heuristic 3: User control and freedom & Heuristic 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>
      <p>
        The “user control and freedom” and “flexibility and efficiency of use” heuristics both focus on allowing the
        users to navigate and use the system easily. This in turn gives them the ability to complete their tasks as
        efficiently as possible.
        <br /><br />
        “User control and freedom” puts an emphasis on giving the user options. This includes the ability to navigate
        the system freely, undo or back buttons, and the ability to easily exit unwanted states. This allows the user
        to correct mistakes and backtrack with minimal frustration.
        <br /><br />
        On the other hand, “flexibility and efficiency of use” encourages designing interfaces that cater to both new
        and expert users. Ways to increase a system’s “flexibility and efficiency of use” include the ability for users
        to create custom keyboard shortcuts, customizable settings, and functionalities that expedite more laborious
        tasks on the system. This allows both frequent users and newcomers to optimize their work environment in a way
        that best suits them.
