            <h1>Making the System Intuitive</h1>
            <h3>Heuristic 2: Match between system and the real world & Heuristic 6: Recognition rather than recall</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of these heuristics is to streamline user interactions by minimizing confusion and cognitive
                effort while navigating the platform by using icons or other aspects that are familiar to the user.
                <br /><br />
                “Matching between the system and the real world” entails creating interfaces that speak the user’s
                language and follow real-world conventions.  In order to best streamline user interaction, the system
                should align with what the users’ pre-existing knowledge about what the system ought to look like.
                This includes using words or phrases common to the users and displaying information in a natural and
                logical order.
                <br /><br />
                “Recognition rather than recall” refers to the need for systems to display information and actions
                explicitly so that users do not need to remember details from previous interactions.  An example of
                this would be using a menu of icons in a text editor instead of memorizing command-line functions to
                edit the text.  This helps to facilitate smoother interactions between the user and system by prompting
                them with visible and easily recognizable cues instead of making users rely on their memory.
