      <p>
        “Matching between the system and the real world” entails creating interfaces that speak the user’s language and
        follow real-world conventions. In order to best streamline user interaction, the system should align with what
        the users’ pre-existing knowledge about what the system ought to look like. This includes using words or
        phrases common to the users and displaying information in a natural and logical order.
