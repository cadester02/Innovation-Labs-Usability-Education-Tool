            <h3>Heuristic 1: Visibility of system status & Heuristic 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3>
            <p>
                These two of Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics both have to deal with the display of things that the
                users will see for a majority of the time spent on your platform
                <br /><br />
                In order for the user to make informed decisions in regards to the system, they will need to know the
                status of some aspects of the system.  These could be battery life, wi-fi connectivity, or even an
                indication that the system has acknowledged the user’s most recent request and is working to complete
                it.
                <br /><br />
                Since these indicators will be visible at almost all times, it is important that they follow an
                aesthetic and minimalist design.  This means that the visual design of the UI is focused on the
                information most relevant to the user.  Unnecessary indicators will only serve to clutter the screen
                and draw attention away from what the user is looking for.
