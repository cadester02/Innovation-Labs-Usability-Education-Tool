      <h1>Heuristic 6: Recognition rather than recall</h1>
      <p>
        “Recognition rather than recall” refers to the need for systems to display information and actions explicitly
        so that users do not need to remember details from previous interactions. An example of this would be using a
        menu of icons in a text editor instead of memorizing command-line functions to edit the text. This helps to
        facilitate smoother interactions between the user and system by prompting them with visible and easily
        recognizable cues instead of making users rely on their memory.
