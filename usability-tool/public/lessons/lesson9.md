# Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

In interface design, the ability to handle errors is a useful aspect. This heuristic focuses on the
importance of guiding users through recognizing, diagnosing, and recovering from errors when they
occur.


Recognizing: The first step in error management is ensuring that users can easily recognize when an
error has occurred. Clear and concise error messages should be displayed, avoiding technical terms
and using **plain language** to communicate the issue. Visual cues such as color coding or icons can
also aid in drawing attention to the problem area.


Diagnosis: Once an error is recognized, users should be able to easily and promptly resolve the issue.
Users need enough information to understand the problem. Error messages should provide meaningful
details about what went wrong, helping users to diagnose the issue without looking to other resources.
Also, offering suggestions or links about further assistance can help users with additional issues.


Recovery: Guiding users through the recovery process is crucial to maintaining a positive user experience.
Design interfaces that guide users toward potential solutions or other actions to solve the error. Offering
a straightforward path to undo or correct mistakes allows users to regain control and continue their
interactions with the system.

Error recovery should be intuitive and well-integrated into the interface. The goal is to minimize
frustration and enable users to continue interacting with the system. Whenever errors do happen, prioritize
user-centered solutions that empower users to feel confident and in control throughout the recovery process.
