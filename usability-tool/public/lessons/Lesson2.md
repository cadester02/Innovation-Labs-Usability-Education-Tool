# Match Between System and the Real World

“Matching between the system and the real world” entails creating interfaces that speak the user’s language 
and follow real-world conventions.  In order to best streamline user interaction, the system should align 
with what the users’ pre-existing knowledge about what the system ought to look like.  This includes using 
words or phrases common to the users and displaying information in a natural and logical order.


One important part of matching between the system and the real world is taking advantage of **user familiarity**. 
Using language that users have seen before and are familiar with will allow them to instantly decipher its 
meaning. Using **symbols** that users are familiar with in the real world can also convey the purpose that symbol 
serves without having to directly tell the user.


These symbols can be found on most sites and are a very clear representation of what they lead to. For example 
having a gear or a wrench for settings, or having a piece of paper icon for documents.

Connecting the system and the real world can also create **intuitive navigation**. Organizing information similarly 
to how users would organize the same information in the real world can create an intuitive navigational flow. 
Mirroring the order that people naturally complete tasks can also create an intuitive flow from one task to 
another that feels natural to the user.


The system must also have **consistent terminology** used throughout. Differing terms that are swapped 
interchangeably can confuse the user and lead the user to be confused. Consistency in language contributes 
to a smooth user experience and avoids any excess confusion that could arise from using differing terms. 
Using terms that are the **industry-standard** can enhance user understanding by utilizing what a user is 
previously familiar with.


Providing users with appropriate **feedback** that matches their expectations for what should happen is 
important in a system. For example if a user presses a button, the user is expecting some sort of visual 
color change with the button, however if the button does not provide a visual color change, the user might 
be confused and will likely perform unwanted additional presses.

**User testing** and **user feedback** are crucial when it comes to understanding the users’ expectations. Without 
properly testing the system with users who are unrelated to the development, the expectations that the 
users’ have with the system will be obscured. Properly testing with users and understanding their feedback 
can help match the real world expectations and the system.
