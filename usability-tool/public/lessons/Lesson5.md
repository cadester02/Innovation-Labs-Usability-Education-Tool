# Error Prevention

“Error prevention” emphasizes designing interfaces such that user errors are **anticipated** and **avoided**. 
This can be accomplished by using clear and descriptive labels for fields, asking for confirmation before 
performing irreversible actions, and constraints that prevent the user from entering invalid data. By 
mitigating errors, users can expect an increase in productivity as well as their experience. Achieving 
error prevention involves several key strategies.


Employing **clear and descriptive labels** for fields, buttons, and interactive elements is crucial. Ambiguity 
in labeling can lead to confusion and errors. By ensuring that labels are specific and informative, such 
as using “Save Changes” instead of “Submit”, users can better understand the intended actions.


Integrating **confirmation dialogs** for actions with **irreversible effects** adds a layer of protection against 
unintended actions. For example, a confirmation message to delete an account is the bare minimum required 
to prevent users from accidentally performing this irreversible action. Dialogs should clearly articulate 
the outcomes of the action and provide users with the option to proceed or cancel.


Implementing advanced **input validation** mechanisms helps prevent users from entering invalid data. Real-time 
feedback on the validity of inputs, paired with clear error messages and suggestions for corrections, guides 
users towards accurate data entry, likely reducing the amount of errors.


By incorporating these strategies into interface design, designers can proactively reduce errors, resulting 
in a smoother and more satisfying user experience.
