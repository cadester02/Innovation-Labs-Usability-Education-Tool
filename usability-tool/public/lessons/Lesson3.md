# User Controls and Freedom

“User control and freedom” emphasizes providing users with options and customization within the system. 
This principle focuses on enabling users to navigate the interface freely, offering features such as undo 
or back buttons, and ensuring the ability to exit unwanted features. By giving users control over their 
interactions, they can correct mistakes and backtrack with minimal frustration.


Many systems will include a way for a user to change the keyboard shortcuts to suit their needs. For 
example the Windows 10 gamebar shortcut setting lets the user change the shortcut for multiple settings.

This heuristic focuses on the concept of empowering users to make decisions and navigate the system 
according to their own preferences. Offering this **intuitive navigation** allows users to move through the 
interface with confidence, giving off a sense of control and mastery.


The addition of undo or back buttons is essential in allowing users to reverse actions or navigate to 
previous states easily. These features serve as **safety nets**, providing users with the freedom to explore 
features without the fear of consequences. Whether it’s revisiting a previous step in a process or 
undoing an unintended action, these controls offer users reassurance and confidence in their actions.


Just as important is the ability to easily exit out of unwanted states or actions. Users should be able to 
exit or cancel tasks, dialogs, or processes without encountering obstacles or confusion. Clear and well 
placed exit options ensure that users can easily disengage from interactions they no longer wish to perform.


For example in Discord whenever attaching a file, the user can easily exit out of that state by clicking 
the trash can before submitting. This gives the user time to confirm as well as cancel out of that state.

By prioritizing user control and freedom in interface design, designers empower users to navigate and 
interact with confidence and ease. Through intuitive navigation, reliable undo functions, and 
accessible exit options, users can navigate the system easily, correcting errors and exploring without 
frustration or hesitation.
