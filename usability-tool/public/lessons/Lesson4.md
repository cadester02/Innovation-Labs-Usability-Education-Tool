# Consistency and Standards

Consistency and compliance with established standards are important principles in interface design as a 
whole. The goal is to create a **predictable** and **intuitive** experience for users. This applies to 
everything within a system, including design elements, interactions, and behavior in general.


**Consistent Design Elements:** Ensure consistency in visual design elements throughout the interface. For 
example, color schemes, button styles, icons, font, and layout should remain relatively the same 
along the website or application. This creates a sense of familiarity for the user, enabling them to 
navigate all features of the application with ease.


**Standardized Interactions:** User interface designers should adopt the concept of standardized 
interaction patterns and behavior to improve user predictability. Users should have familiar actions 
and reactions when interacting with the interface and elements within it. There should be similar 
behavior among all elements when clicking, dragging, scrolling, and any other type of input. This will 
hopefully eliminate another cause of user confusion or frustration, contributing to a seamless user 
experience.


**Consistency Across Devices and Platforms:** Ensure consistency in user experience across different 
devices and platforms. Interfaces should be designed so that they seamlessly adapt to different screen 
sizes, resolutions, and input methods. This should all be done without hindering the usability of the 
website. These familiar experiences are what improve general usability and encourage further user 
engagement across all platforms.


A bad example of consistency accross devices and platforms would be Discord mobile and the Discord web app. 
While to access the direct messages on the web app you click the logo in the top left, on mobile it is 
another page at the bottom of the screen. Here is an example of the difference between web and mobile.

Above is the web app where the servers are below the direct messages.

Above is the mobile app which has tabs for servers and messages. Meaning that consistency across devices is not 
preserved.


**Compliance with Accessibility Standards:** Comply with accessibility standards to ensure everyone has 
consistent access to information and functionality for users with disabilities. The interface should 
be designed to accommodate a variety of needs, such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and 
alternative input methods. These features help to promote inclusivity for all users.


By prioritizing consistency and adhering to standards in interface design, designers can create a 
user experience that leads to user **satisfaction** and **engagement**. This heuristic serves as a 
guiding principle for creating interfaces that are user-friendly and intuitive.
